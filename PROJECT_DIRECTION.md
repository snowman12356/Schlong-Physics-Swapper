# Schlong Physics Swapper - project direction

This file is the permanent high-level direction for SPS. Read it before planning
or implementing project changes. Detailed implementation plans belong in the
`docs` directory and must remain consistent with this direction.

## Permanent update rule

Update this file after every change to the mod. Changes to native or Papyrus
code, configuration, compatibility components, tests, build/package tooling or
user-visible behaviour must update the development status and next gate below
in the same working change whenever practical. Git history and the detailed
documents in `docs` remain the implementation record; this file must always
provide an accurate high-level view of where SPS stands and what comes next.

## Purpose

SPS is becoming a dependable physics-management system for the player and,
later, selected NPCs. It should consistently coordinate SMP and CBPC without
requiring users to repair the state manually.

## Priorities

1. **Player reliability first.** Loading a game, changing arousal, equipping or
   removing armour, entering or leaving scenes, and external physics resets must
   leave the player in the correct state.
2. **Maintainable architecture.** Keep settings, decisions, runtime adapters,
   arousal, scenes, position, recovery, diagnostics and MCM presentation
   separated. New fixes should not destabilise unrelated systems.
3. **Runtime compatibility.** Preserve Skyrim SE, AE and VR support through
   CommonLibSSE-NG where possible.
4. **Managed NPC support after the player is stable.** Users will be able to
   select NPCs and add or remove them from SPS management. Managed NPCs should
   receive SPS switching, transitions, scene handling, positioning and bounded
   recovery. Unmanaged NPCs must retain standard SOS/arousal-mod behaviour.
5. **Low overhead.** Prefer events, bounded queues and strict managed-actor
   limits over constant world scanning or heavy polling.
6. **Cooperative compatibility.** SPS should take ownership only when needed and
   should coexist with supported arousal, scene and physics mods. HDT-SMP Flex
   support is not currently planned.

## Non-negotiable compatibility rules

- Preserve existing settings, INI keys, defaults and saved values.
- Preserve save compatibility and existing working player behaviour.
- Do not enable NPC support until the player regression checklist passes.
- Do not reintroduce the abandoned experimental semi-state.
- Keep DLL and Papyrus bridge files version-matched in every test package.
- Do not modify an installed Skyrim mod, publish a release, or push public
  changes unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Current development status

Development continues on `codex/codebase-rework`. The workspace migration and
cleanup are complete, the reproducible native/Papyrus/package workflow passes,
and the player implementation now has modular decision, runtime, ownership,
arousal, scene, position, recovery, compatibility and diagnostics boundaries.
The obsolete OneDrive workspace and reproducible build/output caches have been
removed, and the reduced external dependency set passes the environment check.

The current 1.9.6 development package has passed automated builds, core tests
and package validation. On 2026-09-01 it was installed only in the dedicated
MO2 test mod at `D:\Modding\mods\Schlong Physics Swapper`; it has not been
released. The clean test install uses OSL Aroused 2.9.3 support, omits the
optional OStim and legacy OSL bridges, and preserves the user's existing SPS
INI. Its DLL SHA-256 is
`65D5FFC64448381A38B7E0104EACA7EAAB1AEC0BF1D0495000DA20204881FD4E`.

The next gate is the documented in-game player regression pass covering
load/save boundaries, arousal changes, soft and erect equipment changes,
manual repair and SexLab behaviour. Optional OStim behaviour remains a separate
experimental test when its bridge is deliberately installed. Do not begin
managed NPC support until the player gate has passed.
